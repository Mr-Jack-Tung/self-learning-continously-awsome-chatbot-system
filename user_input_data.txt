What is machine learning? -> Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
What is artificial intelligence? -> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
How does a neural network work? -> Neural networks are algorithms inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns.
What is deep learning? -> Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, using algorithms based on artificial neural networks.
Explain the difference between AI and ML. -> AI is the broad concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a smart way, whereas ML is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn from data.
